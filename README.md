# Publications
This is a list of the my author and co-author publications.\
Refereed publications of the ATLAS Collaboration are limited to those published in international journals or conferences in which I played a leading role. It should be noted that I has also published several internal notes within the ATLAS Collaboration not listed here due to confidentiality issues.
